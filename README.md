# LogViewer â€” Aruba Log Parser & Visualizer

**LogViewer** is a Python-based tool for parsing and visualizing logs generated by Aruba CX switches. It supports parsing logs such as `event.log`, `critical.log`, `journalctl` directories, and `.supportlog` files â€” even when bundled inside `.tar.gz` support files.

The output is a structured HTML dashboard that allows you to search, filter, and analyze Aruba logs easily.
